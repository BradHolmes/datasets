# NCBI Datasets and ElasticBLAST at Cofest (BOSC 2022)
July 15, 2022, 9:15 a.m to 4 p.m. CT

Welcome to the NCBI Datasets and ElasticBLAST session at Cofest (BOSC 2022). Here you will have a chance to learn more about both tools, explore options and learn how to use them for your research. We have a Jupyter Notebook with tutorials and we are also here to answer any questions.

### How can you help us? 
NCBI Datasets and ElasticBLAST are recent projects and we are in active development. We would love to hear your feedback regarding the usability of the tools and new features that you would like to see. We also are looking for feedback on our documentation: is it easy to use? Are there any specific tutorials that would be helpful?
All ideas are welcome and we will share them with our teams and incorporate them to future developments if possible.
