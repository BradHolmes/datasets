## NCBI DATASETS Workshop at CSHL 2021

### November 2, 2021, 9 a.m to 12 p.m.

### Finding Data using New Features on NCBI Datasets

Need workshop description here

We'll run through these hands-on exercises: 

1.) activity 1 description

2.) activity 2 description

We will also provide demonstrations and examples to help you better understand how to build your own searches and find the data you want. 

We will be using Jupyter Notebooks to do demonstrate searches but no prior command-line or Jupyter Notebook experience is required. By the end of this seminar you will know how to find datasets for genes/genomes and orthologs based on parameters that interest you.
