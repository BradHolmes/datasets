## NCBI DATASETS Workshop at CSHL 2021

### November 2, 2021, 9 a.m to 12 p.m.

### Finding Data using New Features on NCBI Datasets

Need workshop description here

We'll run through these hands-on exercises: 

1.) activity 1 description

2.) activity 2 description

We will also provide demonstrations and examples to help you better understand how to build your own searches and find the data you want. 

We will be using Structured Query Language (SQL) to do these searches but no prior SQL experience is required. By the end of this seminar you will know how to run cloud metadata queries to find SRA data based on parameters that interest you.

Please be advised that in many cases the permissions have been set to allow Notebooks to run on our servers. Some additional programs may need to be loaded to help the notebooks run if they are transferred elsewhere.  Also, permissions to make queries to BigQuery and AWS require credentials that can be set up by your institution.
