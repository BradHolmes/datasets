## Methods

### NewV1FeatureCounts

`func NewV1FeatureCounts() *V1FeatureCounts`

NewV1FeatureCounts instantiates a new V1FeatureCounts object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewV1FeatureCountsWithDefaults

`func NewV1FeatureCountsWithDefaults() *V1FeatureCounts`

NewV1FeatureCountsWithDefaults instantiates a new V1FeatureCounts object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetGeneCounts

`func (o *V1FeatureCounts) GetGeneCounts() V1GeneCounts`

GetGeneCounts returns the GeneCounts field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetGeneCountsOk

`func (o *V1FeatureCounts) GetGeneCountsOk() (*V1GeneCounts, bool)`

GetGeneCountsOk returns a tuple with the GeneCounts field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetGeneCounts

`func (o *V1FeatureCounts) SetGeneCounts(v V1GeneCounts)`

SetGeneCounts sets GeneCounts field to given value.

### HasGeneCounts

`func (o *V1FeatureCounts) HasGeneCounts() bool`
